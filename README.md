# burger-shop-game
This is a game I created with Python, inspired by Papa's Burgeria!

- This programs intended function is to simulate working at a burger shop. 
- Customers will periodically arrive and prompt the user for menu items. 
- Users must test their memory and assemble the correct burger. 
= The goal is to last as long as possible without going bankrupt
